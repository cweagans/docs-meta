## Pull requests

In general, it's better to discuss a potential change before implementing it. If you have a specific feature in mind,
please open a feature request and mention that you're planning on working on it. If a feature request already exists and
has the `help-wanted` label, it's likely that a pull request adding the feature would be accepted.

### Workflow

Fork the project, create a feature branch, and send a pull request. Please sign your commits if possible.

### Coding style fixes

We generally do not accept pull requests that are solely code style fixes. We prefer that style fixes are done as part
of other pull requests to avoid unnecessary churn.
