* Roadmap
    * Redirects from .htaccess via a per-project configuration file (redirects.yaml or something along those lines, which generates .htaccess entries)
    * PR environments??
    * Doc search per-section
    * Scroll spy for table of contents
    * Manual menu setup?
    * Redirect section pages to their first page (we don't use the section pages for anything other than the menu headings)
    * Get rid of the Hugo-generated RSS feeds
    * Re-enable sitemap
    * Use prism styles from upstream template for code highlighting (or pick a different syntax theme that looks better)
    * Import project update feed for each project home page?
    * Maybe versioned documentation
    * Maybe a project picker in the header
